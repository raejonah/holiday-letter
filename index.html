      <p>
      Happy holidays, from my home to yours!
      </p>

      <p>
      2025 was a year of 
      <a href="#" onclick="showImage(event, 'images25/big_achievements.jpg', this)">big achievements
      </a>
      and big changes. In June, I completed my Ph.D. in Physics and Astronomy at UC Irvine, where my research focused on understanding exoplanets and the stars they orbit. I successfully defended my thesis, 
      <a href="#" onclick="showImage(event, 'images25/defeat_snake.jpg', this)">defeated</a>
      the

      </a>
          , and celebrated a job well done.
      </p>

      <p>
      In September I moved to College Park, Maryland, to begin a postdoctoral fellowship at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. My work here is on the Pandora SmallSat (a very small mission!) and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (a very big mission!) Both telescopes will be launching in 2026, and I can't wait to see what we learn about space with them!
      </p>

      <p>
      Living near DC has been quite an adventure. My work was heavily affected by the government shutdown in October and November, but I'm still employed and spent the time engaged in public outreach and 
      <a href="#" onclick="showImage(event, 'images25/advocacy.jpeg', this)">scientific advocacy</a>
       on Capitol Hill. I've also been having fun setting up my new apartment, making new friends, and exploring the city (there are so many farmers markets here!)
      </p>

      <p>
      Outside of work, it has been a great year for my hobby of creative writing. One of my

      short stories
      </a>
      got selected for the Metastellar "Best of 2024" anthology, and I will have another appearing in another literary magazine in a few months! I've had great fun working as the editor of the webcomic Foreach, and even got to attend a comic fair and sell merch for the first time!
      </p>

      <p>
      This year was also full of excursions! Between school and work, I found plenty of time to get off the beaten path, whether that was roadtripping with Mom, to traveling to conferences, celebrating my 10 year highschool reunion, dressing up for fantasy conventions and renn faires, attending so many weddings.
      </p>

      <p>
      But like always, the best part of 2025 was the people! Whether that was reconnecting with old friends, making new ones, getting to know my coworkers, or spending time with my loved ones — it's all of you that make my life so special.
      </p>

      <p>
      Here's to a fantastic 2026!
      </p>

      <p>
      With Love,
      </p>

        This year we traveled to
        <a href="#" onclick="showImage(event, 'images/paris.jpg', this)">Paris</a>,
        
        and spent a lot of time outdoors.
